# Running code please refer the main readme file.
# Usage
- **step1.** generate training samples---demo_trainingG (call MRH_trainingG.m);
- **step2.** training a neural-network from training samples---demo_training (call MRH_training.mlx);
- **step3.** generate testing data---demo_testingG (call MRH_testingG.m);
- **step4.** generate virtual histology from testing data voxel-by-voxel using trained neruo-network from step2--- demo_testing (call MRH_testing.mlx).
- **step5.** reconstruct the whole brain/one slice virual histology from voxel data---MRH_recon.m.
