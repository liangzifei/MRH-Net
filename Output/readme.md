# Examples of vitual histology from MRH in our manuscript (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.072561v1.article-metrics)

- MRH_autofluo_output.zip contains examples of outputs from the MRH-AF network.  
- MRH_nissl_output.zip contains examples of outputs from the MRH-nissl network.
- MRH_axon_output.zip contains examples of outputs from the MRH-NF network.
- MRH_myelin_outputHealth.zip and MRH_myelin_outputShiverer.zip contain examples of output from the MRH-MBP networks based on inputs of control and hypomyelinated shiverer mouse brains, respectively. 
- YPred_audo.mat contains examples of voxel-wise pseudo autofluorescence from MRH-AF(by MRH_testing.mlx) as described in our manuscript.

Further details on the output data can be found in our manuscript.
