# Usage
- step1. generate training data;
- step2. training a neuro-network from training data;
- step3. generate testing data;
- step4. generate virtual histology from testing data voxel-by-voxel using trained neruo-network in step2.
- step5. reconstruct the whole brain virual histology volume from voxel data.
# Training
- prepare training data using code trainingxxx.m

    Please locate the data in one folder: named folder_dwi in the code.


# Testing
